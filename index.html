              <p>Marie Tharp's fascination with nature began as a child traveling the country with her father who worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture creating soil clasification maps. As an adult, she acquired her bachelor's degree in English and music, and then a master's in Geology followed by a second master's in Mathematics. In 1947 she joined Bruce Heezen on a project to map the ocean floor. Since women were considered bad luck on boats, she was not allowed to join the deep sea expeditions and so mapped the data in the lab brought back by Heezen. At the time, scientists believed that the ocean floor was flat; however, Marie believed that the scars she found on the ocean floor were the edges of plate tectonics. She believed the scars proved the continents were once joined, being the first to prove Wegener's theory about the Continental Drift. Hezeen disregarded her arguments as "girl talk." At that time believing in such theory could get her fired but she never gave up. She continued to map the ocean floor at home and later proved that the plate tectonics were real, changing Geology forever. </p>
